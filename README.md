> **A high-frequency trading (HFT) platform built for ultra-low latency execution and intelligent strategy discovery.**

---

## Project Motivation



HFT_Trading_System is designed to answer two fundamental questions:

1. **How can we make trading faster?**  
   → Hardware-efficient C++ execution, lock-free data pipelines, and optimized memory design.

2. **What are the best strategies to trade?**  
   → Data-driven discovery using reinforcement learning, deep learning, and statistical inference.

##  Key Features

###  **Ultra-Low-Latency Core**
- **C++17 Execution Engine**: Sub-microsecond order processing via Pybind11  
- **Lock-Free Queues**: Concurrent order book and market data handling  
- **Hardware Optimization**: SIMD vectorization, cache alignment, NUMA-aware design  

###  **Strategy Research Layer**
- **Classical Strategies**: Momentum, Mean Reversion, Statistical Arbitrage  
- **ML-Based Models**: LSTM, Transformer, and Gradient Boosting  
- **RL & Imitation Learning**: PPO, DQN, Soft Behavior Cloning  
- **Ensemble Framework**: Combine multiple models for regime-robust performance  

###  **Evaluation & Risk Control**
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Sharpe, Sortino, and drawdown tracking  
- **Backtesting Engine**: Vectorized tick-level simulation  
- **Risk Constraints**: Position sizing, stop-loss, CVaR bounds

## Future Work  

Future development will focus on three research-driven directions:  

1. **Statistical Computing Optimization**  
   Designing algorithms with **lower space and time complexity**, leveraging numerical linear algebra, memory-efficient data structures, and distributed computing to further reduce computational overhead in ultra-high-frequency settings.  

2. **Microstructure-Aware Strategy Adaptation**  
   Developing **adaptive HFT strategies** that respond to evolving market microstructures — such as order flow imbalance, spread dynamics, and latency arbitrage — using online learning and reinforcement frameworks optimized for ultra-low latency execution.  

3. **Real-Time Trading**  
Integrating **live execution** via the Alpaca API to enable real-time market connectivity,allowing strategies to transition from simulation to live markets with automated order routing, latency tracking, and adaptive control for production-grade trading deployment.
